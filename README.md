# Doc-bot ü©∫ ‚Äì Simple Medical Chatbot

Doc-bot is a chatbot that answers health-related questions using a medical PDF book.  
Built with React, FastAPI, Gemini AI, and Pinecone.

Example: ‚ÄúWhat are the side effects of antidepressants?‚Äù

## How It Works
- Frontend: React app (App.jsx) for chatting.
- Backend: FastAPI (app.py) searches the book & calls AI.
- AI Service (Node.js): geminiService.js uses the Gemini API to generate answers based on the retrieved context.

- Vector Search (Pinecone): Stores embeddings (vector representations) of the medical PDF's text chunks for fast similarity search.

- RAG Pipeline:

    - Document Processing ‚Äì The PDF is split into small chunks (few hundred words) for better search accuracy.
    - Embeddings ‚Äì Each chunk is converted into a numeric vector using an embedding model.
    - Storage ‚Äì These vectors are stored in Pinecone‚Äôs vector database.
    - Query ‚Äì When a user asks a question, it is converted to a vector embedding.
    - Retrieval ‚Äì Pinecone finds the most similar text chunks from the stored vectors.
    - Answer Generation ‚Äì The retrieved chunks are sent to Gemini AI along with the question to create a contextual, accurate answer.



## Setup & Run

### 1. Create `.env` in Doc-bot folder
 
```bash
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
PORT=4000
```
### 2. Run FastAPI Backend

```bash
cd Doc-bot
python -m venv docBot
source docBot/Scripts/activate # On Windows use: docBot\Scripts\activate
pip install fastapi==0.115.4 uvicorn==0.32.0 langchain langchain-pinecone sentence-transformers==4.1.0 requests python-dotenv
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080


```
### 3. Run Gemini Server
```bash


cd Doc-bot
npm install express cors dotenv
node geminiService.js

```

### 4. Run React Frontend

```bash
cd medical-chatbot
npm install
npm start

```
